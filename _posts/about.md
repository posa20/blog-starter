### Simplimate was founded with a simple idea; the digital automation strategy principles that we’ve developed and implemented in large organisations could be translated & applied to any business in any sector, government or private. 

#### Title. 

With a combined 35 years experience, we’ve successfully developed, designed and implemented digital transformation strategies for hundreds of business processes and thousands of users.

Starting such a transformation journey is difficult; there are pitfalls and expensive mistakes that companies really can’t afford to make; even with big budgets and skilled resources many projects fail to deliver on the promise of automation.

We knew there was a better way. We’ve refined our approach and developed a rapid light-touch methodology that focuses on delivering outcomes sooner, one that works with businesses to get outcomes all whilst building internal capability so we can get out sooner and let companies get back to business.

Simplimate is not about adding another tool, another program, another process, it’s about creating a culture of rapid improvement with an ‘automation first‘ mindset. Ultimately it’s about people working together effectively to deliver better experiences for customers.
